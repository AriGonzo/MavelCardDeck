#Marvel Card Deck

###Why?
After wanting to brush up on Angular, I decided to throw together this little project based on the great work done by algolia on their [Marvel Search](https://github.com/algolia/marvel-search) but wanted to use Angular.

Utilizing Directives and Factories, I am pulling in the JSON collection scraped by algolia and churning out a deck of cards. You can scroll horizontally to view the cards and clicking on them will flip them over.

2. Implement filters
3. Style the back of the cards
4. Adjust the size of the cards so one is in focus
